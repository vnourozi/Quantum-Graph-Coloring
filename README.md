# Quantum Graph Coloring Project

This project implements a quantum algorithm for graph coloring using Qiskit. It demonstrates how quantum computing can be applied to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

## Overview

Graph coloring is a problem where we assign colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This implementation uses a quantum circuit to explore possible colorings and measures the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Qiskit
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install qiskit networkx matplotlib
```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python quantum_graph_coloring.py
```

This will:
1. Create a simple graph
2. Implement a quantum circuit for graph coloring
3. Run the quantum circuit on a simulator
4. Interpret and visualize the results

## Results

Here are the key results from running the quantum graph coloring algorithm:

1. Original Graph:

2. Valid Colorings Found:

3. Visualized Colorings:
   [Insert images of graphs with valid colorings here]

4. Measurement Outcomes:
   [Insert bar plot of top measurement outcomes here]

## How It Works

1. The quantum circuit creates a superposition of all possible colorings.
2. Quantum gates are applied to mark invalid colorings.
3. The circuit is measured multiple times.
4. Classical post-processing interprets the results to find valid colorings.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more sophisticated quantum algorithms for graph coloring
- Test on larger and more complex graphs
- Optimize the circuit for better performance
